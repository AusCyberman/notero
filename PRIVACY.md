# Privacy Policy

The Notero plugin collects only the data necessary to synchronize with Notion;
specifically, this includes the user's Notion integration token and database ID.
These values are stored on the user's local computer alongside Zotero's other
preferences within the [Zotero profile directory][zotero-profile].
These values are transmitted to Notion for purposes of synchronization.
They are not transmitted anywhere else.

As part of the synchronization process, user-generated Zotero item data may be
transmitted to Notion.
These may include but are not limited to: notes, tags, and custom fields.
Data saved in Notion is subject to [Notion Terms and Privacy][notion-terms].

The Notero plugin does not communicate with any services other than Notion.
